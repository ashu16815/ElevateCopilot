          I'm committed to making <strong>AI literacy a public good in New Zealand</strong>. 
          After years leading digital initiatives and helping teams adopt modern tools, I saw a gap: 
          many professionals want to use AI confidently, but don't know where to start—or how to do it safely at work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          So I created <strong>ElevateCopilot</strong> as a <strong>mission-first, open initiative</strong> to train 
          <strong> 1,000 professionals</strong> and empower each to pass their skills to <strong>ten more people</strong>. 
          Every session is free, practical, and designed for real work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          My goal isn't just better tools—it's <strong>better outcomes</strong>: hours saved, clearer communications, 
          smarter analysis, and safer practices across NZ's public and private sectors. I also aspire to serve as a 
          <strong> CIO/CDO</strong> in the region, contributing to national capability and workforce uplift.
